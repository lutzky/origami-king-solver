# Origami King Solver

This is a solver for [Paper Mario: The Origami King][game-wikipedia]'s battle mode. I wrote it in anger as I couldn't solve a puzzle that kept coming up, and I was determined to prove it's unsolvable. It is solvable after all. See `super-annoying-hard` in [the tests](origamikingsolver_test.go).
